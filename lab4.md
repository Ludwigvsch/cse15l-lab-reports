Key Pressed
```
<up><enter>

The ssh cs15lfa23hf@ieng.ucsd.edu command was 1 up in the search history of my terminal, hence I used the up arrow key to access it. It basically just connects to the server int my specific account online automatically since my key is saved on it.

Key Pressed

```
git clone <Command-V><enter>
```

I copied the ssh url from my forked repository and paste the url into my terminal. This clones the repository into my account on the server.

Key Pressed
```
cd l<tab><enter>
bash t<tab><enter>
```
I used the cd command and typed l and tab to complete the name of the directory and navigate into lab7/.
Then run the test with bash and type t and tab to auto complete the filename test.sh in lab7/.

Key Pressed
```
vim L<tab>.j<tab><enter>
:44<enter>11lr2:wq<enter>
```
I opened vim editor using vim and the filename. Typing L and tab auto complete the filename, since there are two files that have similar filename, I type another . and j and tab to auto complete again.
:44 to go directly to line 44
11l move cursor right 11 characters
r to replace the 1 with 2
type :wq and ```<enter>```to save the file and quit

Key Pressed
```
<up><up><enter>
```
The bash command was 2 up in the search history, so I used up arrow twice to access it.

**Step 9**

Key Pressed
```
git add .<enter>
git status<enter>
git commit -m "lab4"<enter>
git push<enter>
```
I used git add to add files with changes to staging state. '.' means add all files.

I used git status to check if file successfully added to staging area.

Then git commit with -m option to give commit a message.

Finally, used git push to update the forked lab7 repository (ony my account).
